        <p>
          Hi there, my name is Mauricio, I was born in a beautiful country with
          good sea food and beautiful mountains called Chile &#128511; but I
          live since I was a kid in another beautiful, hot and tropical country
          called Brazil &#127758; I have a beautiful wife and a beloved son, but
          I dream of having at least 3 children (I am still trying to convince
          my wife &#128517;).
        </p>

        <p>
          I love to travel and see new places, I also love to play video games
          &#128125; especially RPG's like The Witcher.
        </p>

          To start in the IT area was not easy, since teenager I had to pay for
          my studies, I worked for 9 years in a metallurgical company making
          high voltage transformers, then I decided to leave &#128640; and start
          from scratch, everyone called me crazy, because my salary was high and
          the IT internship would earn less than a minimum wage.
        </p>

        <p>
          But sometimes to achieve the dreams and success we have to make tough
          choices. And I started my journey on a Help Desk internship, but soon
          after I left the company I went to another software development
          internship &#128187; at a company that I admire to this day called
          ilegra, located in Porto Alegre.
        </p>

          Since 2019 I have been working on several national projects in Brazil
          and in December 2021 I realized my dream of working at a company in
          Silicon Valley remotely &#11088; thanks to a referral from a former
          leader and work friend.
